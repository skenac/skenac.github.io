<p>Our research is driven by a desire to understand the microscopic processes that take place in optical materials, with the aim of using them in state-of-the-art optoelectronic devices. <em>Of course sometimes we are just happy discovering funky new physics!</em> In the group, we fabricate most of our own samples, build experimental setups to measure their properties and make complete devices that we can test.</p>

<p><strong>Strong light-matter coupling.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Organic light-emitting diodes and organic lasers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mid-infrared devices based on 2D black phosphorus</strong></p>

<p><strong>Optical antennas and optical nonlinearities</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Photophysics of novel materials</strong></p>
