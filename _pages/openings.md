### Fellowship opportunities ###
Canada and Québec have generous fellowship programs for PhD students and postdocs. The information can be found [here](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/index_eng.asp) and [here](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/programme/bourses-dexcellence-pour-etudiants-etrangers-pbeee/) for PhD students and [here](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/app-dem_overview-apercu.html) and [here](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/merit-scholarship-program-for-foreign-students-pbeee/) for postdocs. **Important: if you wish to apply for a fellowship, please [contact me](mailto:s.kena-cohen@polymtl.ca) before the end June at the latest**, because time is required to prepare a package and you must (in many cases) be internally selected from the institutional quota.
Specific partnership programs exist for students from Brazil, China, India, Israel, Mexico and Wallonia.
