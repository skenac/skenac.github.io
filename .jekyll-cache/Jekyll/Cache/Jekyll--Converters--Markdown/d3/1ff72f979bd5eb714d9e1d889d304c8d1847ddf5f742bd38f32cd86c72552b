<p>Our research lies at the interface between semiconductor physics, photonics and quantum optics. It is driven by a desire to understand the microscopic processes that take place in optical materials, with the aim of using them in state-of-the-art optoelectronic devices. <em>Sometimes though we are just happy discovering funky new physics!</em> In the group, we fabricate most of our own samples, build experimental setups to measure their properties and make complete devices that we can test. Our areas of interest are always evolving, but here are a few things that we are working on at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Strong light-matter coupling.</strong> <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/polariton.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px" /> A longstanding research area in the group has been the regime of strong light-matter coupling. When some form of optical excitation (such as exciton) interacts strongly enough with a mode of the electromagnetic field, new quasiparticles called polaritons can form. These polaritons are <em>part-light, part-matter</em> that share some properties from both. Because they are bosons, they can form Bose-Einstein condensatesâ€“even at room-temperature. Lattices of these condensates can be used for quantum simulation, and single condensates can be used as low-threshold lasers. One current challenge, when organic materials are used, is to lower the lasing threshold sufficiently so that condensates can be realized with cheap laser diodes. Another area we are exploring is to better understand how strong coupling can change the underlying properties of molecules themselves. Can phenomena such as conductivity, interesystem crossing, exciton dissociation be changed simply by changing the optical environment around the molecule? This could have important repercussion for many types of organic optoelectronic devices.</p>

<p><strong>Organic light-emitting diodes and organic lasers.</strong> <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/oled.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px" />Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are now routinely found in mobile displays and high end televisions, but the technology still faces several challenges for other applications. OLED efficiencies plummet in the UV and near-infrared. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of using thermally-assisted delayed fluorescence to achieve high quantum efficiencies at 840 nm. However, strategies for pushing this further are lacking. In addition, the efficiency tends to drop drastically at high current densities, which prevents us from running devices at very high brightness. Most of the mechanisms responsible for this are known, but strategies for drastically improving roll-off are lacking. Finally, organic lasers are easy to fabricate, cheap and easily tunable. However organic lasers tend to only work when pumped with intense short pulses of light. One of the major culprits is the presence of triplet excited-states, but the thermal stability of materials is also an issue. We are trying to develop triplet management strategies to allow for continuous operation of organic lasers at low powers, and hopefully under electrical injection.</p>

<p><strong>Mid-infrared devices based on 2D black phosphorus</strong> <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/bpled.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px" />2D materials like graphene have shown amazing promise for electronics and optoelectronics. These are materials, which are layered in their bulk form, and the different layers can be re-arranged to form complex heterostructures tunable by both the choice of material and the twist-angle between layers. Black phosphorus, in particular, stands out as a truly amazing material. It has a direct bandgap from the monolayer to the bulk, which means that it is always an efficient emitter, and its emission wavelength can be dramatically tuned by applied electric fields, strain or the number of layers. We recently demonstrated the first MIR light-emitting diodes using black phosphorus, and we are working on improving the efficiency. These devices have the potential to dramatically outperform their conventional (and expensive!) epitaxially grown counterparts, and be integrated into complex photonic structures for trace gas sensing and other applications.</p>

<p><strong>Optical antennas and optical nonlinearities</strong> <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/pga.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px  10px" />Like their radio frequency counterparts, optical antennas can re-shape the way light is emitted (say from an atom) or collected. We are designing new types of antennas to drastically enhance the emission of emitters in light-emitting diodes, individual quantum emitters and to increase the strength of nonlinearities by focussing incident light to nanoscale volumes. We are also developping new tools to precisely probe the strength of optical nonlinearities in the non-perturbative regime. Traditional measurement techniques such as Z-scan, fail when nonlinearities (or absorption) are very strong, which is precisely the case close to an optical resonance. Combining the two will allow us to realize efficient modulators, all-optical switches and frequency converters.</p>

<p><strong>Photophysics of novel materials</strong> <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/respic/diffusion.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px" />We are always interested in better understand the behavior of optical excitations in newly discovered semiconductor materials. Our main tools for this are ultrafast spectroscopy and time-resolved microscopy. For example, we recently developped a new single-shot technique to spatially and time-resolve carrier diffusion in the class of perovskites used in solar cells. With this technique, we were able to show that contrary to expectation, thin films with the longest carrier lifetimes did not show the longest diffusion lengths.</p>
